 
Java is a platform-independent, object-oriented programming language that runs on the JVM and is commonly used for backend, enterprise, and Android development.

## ✅ Platform-independent (how to explain it)

**What it means**

> **Platform-independent means Java programs can run on different operating systems without changing the code.**

**How it works (key point interviewers want)**

> Java code is compiled into **bytecode**, not machine code.  
> That bytecode runs on the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, and each OS has its own JVM implementation.

**One-line example**

> _Write once, run anywhere — as long as a JVM exists._

**Strong interview phrasing**

> **Java is platform-independent because it compiles to bytecode, which is executed by the JVM rather than the operating system directly.**


## ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

**What it means**

> **Object-oriented programming organizes code around objects that represent real-world entities and behavior.**

It helps make our code reusable, organized, and easier to maintain which is important for large scale systems by following OOP concepts

**The 4 pillars (say them confidently)**

1. **Encapsulation** –  is the practice of protecting and organizing code inside a class.
    
2. **Inheritance** – reuse and extend existing code
    
3. **Polymorphism** – adds flexibility- allows objects to take multiple forms; 
    
4. **Abstraction** – hide complexity, expose only what’s needed
    

**Strong interview phrasing**

> **Java uses OOP principles to make code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain, which is important for large-scale systems.**


## ✅ _Class vs Object_

> **A class is a blueprint or template that defines properties and behaviors, while an object is a real instance of that class created at runtime.**

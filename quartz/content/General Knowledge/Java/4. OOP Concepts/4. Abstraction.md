### **What**

> **Abstraction** hides implementation details and shows only essential behavior.

### **Why**

> To reduce complexity and improve maintainability.

### **How**

> Achieved by:
> 1.  Abstract classes  
> 2. Interfaces


## **1️⃣ Abstract Class**

**What it is:**

- A class that cannot be instantiated directly.
- Can have **both abstract methods (without body)** and **concrete methods (with implementation)**.

**When to use:**

- When classes share **common behavior or state (fields)**.
- When you want to provide **default behavior** for subclasses.

```
abstract class Vehicle {
    int speed;
    abstract void move();
    
    void start() { System.out.println("Vehicle started"); }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void move() { System.out.println("Car is moving"); }
}
```
✅ Can have fields, constructors, and default method implementations.

## **2️⃣ Interface**

**What it is:**

Historically, interfaces were like strict abstract classes: they could only declare method signatures and constants, forcing implementing classes to provide behavior. In modern Java, interfaces can also include **default and static methods**, which allow some shared implementation while still defining a contract. 

The key difference from abstract classes:
1. is that interfaces **cannot have instance fields**,
2. a class can **implement multiple interfaces**, achieving multiple inheritance of type.


- A contract defining **method signatures only** (until Java 8, interfaces could not have default methods).
- Classes **implement the interface** and provide concrete behavior.

**When to use:**

- To define **capabilities** a class should have.
- To achieve **multiple inheritance of type**, because Java does **not allow multiple class inheritance**.

```
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

interface Swimmable {
    void swim();
}

class Duck implements Flyable, Swimmable {
    public void fly() { System.out.println("Duck flies"); }
    public void swim() { System.out.println("Duck swims"); }
}

```
✅ Cannot have instance fields, only constants (`static final`), but can have **default and static methods** in modern Java.

## **3️⃣ Key Differences**

|Feature|Abstract Class|Interface|
|---|---|---|
|Multiple inheritance|❌ Only one class|✅ Multiple interfaces|
|Methods|Abstract + Concrete allowed|Only abstract (or default/static in modern Java)|
|Fields|Can have instance variables|Only constants (`static final`)|
|Constructor|Yes|No|
|Use case|Shared behavior/state|Contract/capability definition|

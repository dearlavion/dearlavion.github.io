### **What**

> **Encapsulation** is the practice of protecting and organizing code inside a class.

### **Why**

> It prevents accidental changes of internal data 

### **How**

> By using **access modifiers**—making fields private and exposing controlled access through public getters and setters.


```
class User {
    private String email;

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }
}
```

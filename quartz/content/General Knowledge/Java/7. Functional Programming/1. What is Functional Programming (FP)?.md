“Functional programming is a style of programming where we **treat functions as first-class citizens**, avoid mutable state, and write code that focuses on **what to do** rather than **how to do it**.”

## **“Treat functions as first-class citizens”**
**Meaning:**
- Functions can be **passed as arguments**, **returned from other functions**, and **assigned to variables** — just like data.


## Traits / Characteristics of Functional Programming

These are **properties that make code functional**:

| Trait                                 | What it means                                                                | Example                                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Immutability**                      | Data is not changed; new data is created                                     | `List<Integer> squared = numbers.stream().map(n->n*n).collect(...)` |
| **Side-effect-free / Pure functions** | Functions do not modify external state and return same output for same input | `int square(int x) { return x*x; }`                                 |
| **First-class functions**             | Functions can be passed around, returned, or assigned                        | `Function<String,Integer> f = String::length`                       |
| **Declarative style**                 | Focus on what to do, not how                                                 | `names.stream().filter(...).collect(...)`                           |
| **Higher-order functions**            | Functions can accept other functions as arguments                            | `.map(Function)`                                                    |

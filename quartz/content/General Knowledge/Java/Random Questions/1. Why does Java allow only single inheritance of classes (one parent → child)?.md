Java allows a class to extend only **one parent class** to **avoid the diamond problem**
	Occurs when multiple parent classes have methods with the same signature.

Single inheritance keeps the **class hierarchy simple and predictable**, reduces ambiguity, and makes code easier to maintain.

**“Java solves multiple inheritance using interfaces instead”**

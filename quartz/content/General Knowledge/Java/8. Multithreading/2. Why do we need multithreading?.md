> **“We need multithreading to let a program do multiple tasks at the same time, keeping it responsive, increasing performance, and making full use of multi-core CPUs.”**

### Key reasons (memorize these 3):
1. **Responsiveness** – UI doesn’t freeze
2. **Throughput** – handle more tasks at once
3. **Resource utilization** – use multiple CPU cores



## **CPU Cores & Parallelism**
> “Concurrency is about managing multiple tasks, while parallelism is about executing them simultaneously on multiple CPU cores.”

### Important distinction
- **Concurrency** → tasks _appear_ to run at the same time
- **Parallelism** → tasks _actually_ run at the same time on multiple cores

### Example
- 1 core → context switching
- 4 cores → true parallel execution



## **Context Switching (Performance Cost)**
> “Context switching allows concurrency on a single core but comes with overhead, so creating too many threads hurts performance.”

### What it is
- CPU switches between threads
- Saves & restores thread state

### Why it matters
- Too many threads → **performance degradation**

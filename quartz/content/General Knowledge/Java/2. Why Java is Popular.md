Java is popular because it’s platform-independent, strongly typed, and object-oriented. In addition, it has a huge ecosystem with frameworks like Spring Boot and Hibernate, which provide powerful tools and abstractions that allow developers to **solve problems faster without reinventing the wheel.**

- **Platform independent** – runs on any device with a JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
    
- **Strongly typed & safe** – reduces runtime errors - _Errors caught at compile time_
    
- **Object-oriented** – organized and scalable code
    
- **Huge ecosystem** – Faster development, proven libraries - frameworks like Spring Boot, Hibernate
    
- **Very stable** – heavily used in finance, telecom, government

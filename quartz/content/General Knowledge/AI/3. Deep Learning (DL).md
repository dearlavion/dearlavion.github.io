### **What**

> **DL is a subset of ML** that uses multi-layer neural networks to learn complex patterns.

### **Why**

> To handle **unstructured data** like images, audio, and text at scale.

### **How**

> Using neural networks with many layers trained on large datasets using GPUs.

📌 Example: image recognition, speech-to-text.

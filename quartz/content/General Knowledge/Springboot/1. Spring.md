## What is the **Spring Framework**?

> “Spring is a Java framework that provides infrastructure support for building enterprise applications. Its core feature is dependency injection, which helps build loosely coupled, testable, and maintainable applications.”

### Why use Spring?
- Dependency Injection (IoC container)
- Transaction management
- Web framework (Spring MVC)
- Security, data access, messaging

###  Problems Spring Solved
❌ Before Spring
- Classes directly created dependencies using `new
- Tight coupling between classes
- Hard to test (no mocking)    
- Lots of XML configuration
```
class OrderService {
    private PaymentService payment = new PaymentService(); // tightly coupled
}
```

 ✅ With Spring
- Dependencies are injected
- Loose coupling
- Easy testing
- Centralized configuration
```
class OrderService {
    private final PaymentService payment;

    OrderService(PaymentService payment) {
        this.payment = payment;
    }
}
```
“Spring solved tight coupling and boilerplate by managing object creation and wiring through IoC and DI.”

### 🔹 IoC (Inversion of Control)

**Definition:**
> “In IoC, the framework controls object creation and dependency management instead of the developer.”

**Simple explanation:**
- You don’t create objects
- Spring creates and manages them

**Example**
Before
```
Engine engine = new Engine(); 
Car car = new Car(engine);
```
After
```
Car car = context.getBean(Car.class);
```
Control is inverted:
- ❌ Developer → controls object creation
- ✅ Framework → controls object creation


### 🔹 Dependency Injection (DI)

**Definition:**
> “Dependency Injection is a pattern where dependencies are provided to a class instead of being created inside it.”


## IOC vs DI
> **Dependency Injection (DI) is a way to implement Inversion of Control (IoC).**

In other words:
- **IoC = the concept / principle** → “Don’t control object creation yourself; let the framework do it.”
- **DI = the concrete pattern / technique** → “Pass dependencies from the outside instead of creating them internally.”
